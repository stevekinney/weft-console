/**
 * Integration tests for `WorkflowTailSource` against a REAL in-process weft
 * server (`live-source-test-server.test-support.ts`, a plain `serve()`) — no
 * mock server.
 *
 * Uses the `signal-stepped` fixture (`fixtures/workflows.ts`) specifically
 * so this suite can drive checkpoint commits deterministically —
 * `engine.signal(id, 'advance')` — rather than racing real wall-clock
 * timing against a fast-completing workflow.
 *
 * **Scope.** `client.tail()`'s own reconnect/catch-up mechanics are weft's
 * to test (and are — `weft/src/client/event-stream.test.ts`); this source's
 * OWN added value — the outer capped-exponential reconnect layer, positional
 * dedup across reconnects, the pre-attach buffer, terminal-event detection —
 * is exhaustively covered against a scripted fake tail in
 * `workflow-tail-source.test.ts` (deterministic, no server, no real
 * timers). What genuinely needs a real server is proving the WIRE
 * INTEGRATION holds: a real `HttpClient`, real SSE framing, real engine
 * execution driving real committed events, catch-up-then-live delivery
 * through `WorkflowTailSource` end to end. A literal mid-stream network
 * drop has no test-side hook here (Bun's `fetch`/`ReadableStream` gives no
 * way to sever an in-flight SSE response without either killing the whole
 * server or reaching into the operation's own internal `AbortController`,
 * which weft's server does not expose) — "reconnect resume without
 * dup/skip" is proven instead by opening a second, independent tail after
 * more events have committed and confirming its OWN catch-up (the same
 * mechanism a reconnect's fresh `client.tail()` call relies on) delivers
 * everything exactly once, in order.
