/**
 * `WorkflowTailSource` — the per-workflow live event tail (plan §5.1, T1.4):
 * wraps `client.tail(id)` from `@lostgradient/weft/client`.
 *
 * **Why an outer reconnect layer on top of `client.tail()`.** The
 * underlying `WorkflowEventTail` already reconnects internally (both its
 * WebSocket and SSE transports), but its built-in policy is a FAST, SHORT
 * retry (linear backoff from a 50ms base, capped at 5 attempts by default —
 * see `weft/src/client/event-stream.ts`), and once exhausted the tail
 * closes for good with no way to resume it. Plan §5.1 calls for "exponential
 * backoff capped at 30s" with no attempt ceiling — an operator watching a
 * live incident should not have the tail silently give up after under a
 * second of retries. So this source treats the whole `client.tail(id)` call
 * as one attempt: when it ends for any reason other than an explicit
 * `close()` or an observed terminal workflow event, it opens a BRAND NEW
 * `client.tail(id)` after its own capped-exponential delay.
 *
 * **Cross-reconnect dedup.** A fresh `client.tail(id)` call always replays
 * the workflow's FULL persisted history from the start (`getEvents()` under
 * the hood) — it has no memory of a previous, now-closed subscription. To
 * avoid re-delivering everything the subscriber already saw, this source
 * counts how many frames it has delivered so far (`#deliveredCount`) and,
 * on each new tail, skips exactly that many positions before delivering
 * again. `WorkflowEvent` carries no stable sequence id (documented on
 * `client.tail()`'s own JSDoc), so this positional comparison is the same
 * strategy `client.tail()`'s own internal reconnect uses
 * (`#historyWatermark`) — sound in the common case, with the same
 * documented compaction-edge-case caveat that strategy inherits.
 *
 * **Terminal detection.** The public `WorkflowEventTail` interface exposes
 * no `closeReason`, so this source cannot ask the tail *why* its iteration
 * ended. Instead it watches each delivered frame's `.type` itself
 * (`isTerminalWorkflowEventType`, shared with `cache-integration.ts`) — once
 * a terminal lifecycle event has been observed, the workflow is genuinely
 * done and the source settles to `'closed'` instead of reconnecting.
 *
 * **Buffer.** Single-consumer (`subscribe()` throws on a second concurrent
 * caller). The bounded ~500-frame buffer exists ONLY for the pre-attach
 * window — `#connect()` starts in the constructor, before any `subscribe()`
 * call, so frames can arrive before there is anyone to deliver them to. Once
 * a subscriber IS attached, frames go straight to it; there is no
 * steady-state mirror of history sitting behind the buffer (that durability
 * job belongs to the TanStack cache — see plan §5.1 and
 * `cache-integration.ts`). Overflowing the pre-attach buffer means frames
 * were dropped before anyone ever saw them; that's surfaced as `'stale'`.
 *
 * **HMR safety** (plan §2): every live instance is tracked in a
 * module-scope set; `import.meta.hot?.dispose` closes them all before Vite
 * swaps this module out.
