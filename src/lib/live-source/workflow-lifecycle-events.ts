/**
 * Workflow lifecycle event `.type` → `WorkflowStatus` mapping, shared by
 * `WorkflowTailSource` (needs to know when a tail should stop reconnecting)
 * and `cache-integration.ts` (needs to know when to patch a cached
 * `WorkflowSummary.status`). Kept in one module so both agree on the exact
 * same event-type set instead of each maintaining its own copy.
 *
 * weft's own `WORKFLOW_TERMINAL_EVENT_TYPES` (`core/events/workflow-
 * events.ts`) is not a public export, so this is the console's own copy —
 * built from the individual event classes' `.type` statics, which ARE
 * public exports, so this can't silently drift on the *names*, only on the
 * *set* (re-verify against `WorkflowStatus`'s terminal members on every
 * `@lostgradient/weft` bump — `'suspended'` is deliberately excluded: a
 * suspended workflow is resumable, not terminal, per that type's own doc
 * comment).
 *
 * `@lostgradient/weft@0.15.0` shipped weft#751: the event classes
 * themselves (`WorkflowStartedEvent` etc.) are now re-exported from
 * `/client`, not just the package root — importing them here no longer
 * forces a bundler to resolve the root barrel's server-only re-exports
 * (`handleRequest`/`createAuthenticator`, reaching `node:crypto`), the same
 * class of browser-bundle leak `isWeftFault`/`isWeftError*` had before
 * `@lostgradient/weft@0.12.0` moved them to `/client` (weft#722/#733). This
 * module now imports the classes as values and reads their `.type` statics
 * directly instead of hardcoding string literals — the compiler now catches
 * a typo or a renamed event type at build time instead of a silent drift.
 * `WorkflowStatus` itself stays `/client`-agnostic: it is not re-exported
 * from `/client` (only value exports needed the move), so it is still
 * imported `type`-only from the package root — types are erased at compile
 * time and never reach the bundler's module graph either way.
