/**
 * Integration tests for `FleetEventSource` against a REAL in-process weft
 * server (`live-source-test-server.test-support.ts`, a plain `serve()`) — no
 * mock server; the fleet feed is genuinely engine-backed via `serve()`'s own
 * production `wireEventBroadcasting()` wiring.
 *
 * **Scope.** `FleetEventSource`'s own SSE-over-fetch parser, per-subscriber
 * filtering, and client-side reconnect/`Last-Event-ID`/backoff logic are
 * exhaustively covered against a scripted fake `fetch` in
 * `fleet-event-source.test.ts` (deterministic, precise control over frame
 * timing and drops — including a genuine mid-stream network drop, which
 * this suite cannot simulate against a real server; see that file's
 * `reconnects with Last-Event-ID` test). What this suite proves instead:
 * the real wire integration — real HttpClient-adjacent `fetch`, real SSE
 * framing from `sse-stream.ts`, real engine execution (via
 * `wireEventBroadcasting`) producing the events `FleetEventSource` parses
 * and delivers, catch-up-then-live end to end, and that the SERVER's
 * cursor-resume contract (`fromCursor`/`Last-Event-ID`) actually honors a
 * later starting point — the server-side half of what makes client-side
 * reconnect resume meaningful.
