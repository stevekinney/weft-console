/**
 * `QueryClient` factory + query-key helpers (plan §4, T1.5). Frozen after the
 * Phase 1 Foundation gate — see PROJECT-BRIEF "Shared contracts".
 *
 * TanStack Query owns all server state (plan §1.5); this module is the one
 * place that decides its defaults so every domain track builds
 * `createQuery`/`createMutation` calls against the same retry/placeholder/
 * error-reporting behavior instead of re-deciding it per call site.
 *
 * ## Where a fault surfaces (three paths, not one)
 *
 * This client intentionally never sets `throwOnError` on queries — a query
 * failure is meant to degrade the surface to its last-known cached state
 * (plan §5), not unmount it — so `<FaultBoundary>` (`src/app/fault-boundary.svelte`)
 * does NOT see query errors; it only catches exceptions thrown while
 * rendering (a rendering bug, not a wire fault). Route components read
 * `$query.error` directly and pass it through `classifyFault`/`faultTreatment`
 * (`./faults.ts`) to render the same six-treatment `FaultDisplay` banner
 * inline. Mutation failures are the one path this module owns end-to-end:
 * the `mutations.onError` default below reports them as a toast via
 * `showFault`. Three distinct delivery mechanisms for the same
 * classification — not competing ones.

 *   - list queries (`LIST_QUERY_KEY_PREFIXES`) keep the previous page's data
 *     visible while refetching, instead of flashing to a loading state.
 *   - any mutation error is reported as a toast via the fault mapping
 *     (`showFault`) — call sites needing a different/additional treatment
 *     pass their own `onError` to `createMutation`, which runs alongside
 *     this default (TanStack Query calls both).
 *   - `notifyOnChangeProps: 'all'` disables TanStack Query's default
 *     "tracked properties" optimization, which only notifies subscribers
 *     when a result property that was actually READ on the previous render
 *     changes. Several route components derive booleans like `isLoading`
 *     from short-circuited expressions (`scopeGranted && query.isPending`)
 *     — once the left side goes false, the right side stops being read, so
 *     the tracked-properties set silently drops `isPending` and a later
 *     settle never notifies the component (confirmed empirically: the
 *     dashboard's critical-alerts band hangs on its loading skeleton
 *     forever after a query resolves, and stops hanging the moment
 *     anything else in the component unconditionally reads the same
 *     property). `'all'` trades a small amount of over-notification for
 *     correctness independent of which properties a given render happens
 *     to touch.
