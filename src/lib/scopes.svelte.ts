/**
 * Principal + scope gating (plan §6, T1.2). Frozen after the Phase 1
 * Foundation gate — see PROJECT-BRIEF "Shared contracts".
 *
 * The 21 scopes below are flat (`workflows:admin` does NOT imply
 * `workflows:read`) and mirror weft's `AUTHORIZATION_SCOPES` — a public
 * export of `@lostgradient/weft/server` as of 0.18.0. The literal stays
 * duplicated here deliberately: a value import from the server subpath
 * would pull weft's server module graph into the browser bundle, so the
 * console keeps a browser-safe copy and `scopes.svelte.test.ts` pins it
 * byte-identical against the upstream export (the test runs under Bun,
 * where importing the server barrel is fine).
 *
 * ## Principal resolution (weft 0.18.0, `weft.system.principal`)
 *
 * `resolvePrincipal()` calls the principal-introspection operation this
 * module pinned as missing from v0.11.0 through v0.17.0 (plan §14.1 item
 * 4; shipped upstream in 0.18.0). The operation is `access: 'public'` and
 * reports the caller's own resolved principal — method, subject, and the
 * ACTUAL granted scopes — so the old optimistic-grant model (assume all 21
 * scopes, degrade on observed `403`s) is gone: scope gating now starts
 * from the server's authoritative answer.
 *
 * Three outcomes:
 * - **Authenticated** (`method` ≠ `'unauthenticated'`): the granted scopes
 *   verbatim; no banner.
 * - **Anonymous but served** (`method: 'unauthenticated'`): the server has
 *   no `auth` configured — an auth-configured weft rejects uncredentialed
 *   requests at the transport edge before any operation dispatch, public
 *   ones included. Anonymous principals carry zero scopes, so every
 *   scope-gated surface renders disabled-with-reason (truthful: those
 *   operations genuinely reject anonymous callers), while public-access
 *   operations remain usable. `'warn'` vs `'allow'` are still
 *   wire-indistinguishable (both mean "no auth configured"; the option only
 *   gates server BOOT) — the more visible `'warn'` banner is the safe
 *   default.
 * - **`401`**: no principal — the supplied credential was invalid/expired,
 *   or the server requires one (API-key entry must run). The two cases read
 *   identically to callers.
 *
 * `denyScope()`/`isForbidden()` remain as the runtime-degrade path for the
 * residual case of a scope revoked server-side mid-session.
