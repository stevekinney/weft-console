/**
 * Integration coverage for `resolvePrincipal()` against REAL `serve()`
 * instances (plan §11.3: no mock server) — the three-way boot contract in
 * `scopes.svelte.ts`'s module doc, proven on the wire rather than asserted
 * from a stub.
 *
 * Two server shapes are needed because the distinction the console draws is
 * a property of the SERVER's auth posture, not of the request:
 *
 * - **auth configured** — a valid key resolves to an authenticated principal
 *   carrying exactly the scopes that key was granted, and a credential-less
 *   caller is rejected with `401` **even though `weft.system.principal`
 *   declares `access: 'public'`**. That second assertion is the load-bearing
 *   one: the whole mapping rests on "an auth-configured weft never answers
 *   anonymously," so the console can treat a `method: 'unauthenticated'`
 *   response as proof the server has no `auth` at all. If a future weft ever
 *   let public operations through unauthenticated, this test fails and the
 *   `'warn'` banner would start lying — hence pinning it here rather than
 *   trusting the prose.
 * - **no auth configured** — the anonymous caller is served, reporting
 *   `method: 'unauthenticated'` with zero scopes.
 *
 * `port: 0` gives each server an ephemeral port so these can run alongside
 * the other integration suites without collisions.
