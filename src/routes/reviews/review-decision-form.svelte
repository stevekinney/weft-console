  /**
   * The decision-recording surface for a pending review (plan §9.5, Track
   * D). NOT built on Cinder's `ApprovalCard` — see the module doc below for
   * the evaluation this task required documenting.
   *
   * ## ApprovalCard evaluation (required by the task brief)
   *
   * Read `cinder/packages/components/src/components/approval-card/{approval-card.svelte,README.md,approval-card.types.ts}`
   * in full before building this. `ApprovalCard` is a real, shipped
   * component (v0.16.1) but its domain model is a DIFFERENT one: "reviewing
   * a tool operation before the host application executes it" — required
   * props are `tool: { name, risk }`, `sandbox: { provider, name,
   * workingDir }`, `operation: { kind: 'command' | 'patch', command | diff,
   * argsPreview, filesTouched }`, `policyVersion`, `idempotencyKey`,
   * `expiresAt`, and a SINGLE `onresolve(resolution)` callback carrying one
   * `ApprovalResolution` (`decision: 'approve' | 'approve-with-edits' |
   * 'deny' | 'cancel'`). None of that maps onto a Weft human review:
   *   - No concept of `reviewType`/`reviewers`/arbitrary `artifact` content
   *     (Weft's artifact is `unknown` — free-form, not a command/diff).
   *   - No per-SECTION decisions at all — `allowPartial`'s whole point (an
   *     independent approve/reject per named artifact section) has no
   *     analogue in a single `onresolve` callback.
   *   - `sandbox`/`policyVersion`/`idempotencyKey`/`env` are agent-tool-call
   *     concepts with no Weft review equivalent to supply.
   * Forcing the review's shape into `ApprovalCard`'s props would mean
   * inventing fake `tool`/`sandbox`/`operation` values purely to satisfy an
   * unrelated required-prop contract, and would still have nowhere to put
   * per-section decisions — exactly the "fork/wrap to change semantics"
   * pattern PROJECT-BRIEF forbids, just done through misuse of required
   * props instead of a literal fork. This is a domain mismatch, not a
   * missing prop/state gap, so no Cinder issue is filed either — the
   * decision surface below is an app-local composition over `Card`,
   * `Badge`, `SegmentedControl`, `Textarea`, and `Button`, matching how the
   * design reference itself hand-builds this screen rather than embedding
   * `ApprovalCard` markup.
   *
   * ## "Suggested from sections but never locked" (plan §9.5)
   *
   * `overallDecision` auto-follows `suggestOverallDecision(sectionDecisions)`
   * (all sections approved → approve; any rejection → needs-changes) UNTIL
   * the operator picks an overall option themselves — tracked by
   * `overallTouched`. Once touched, the picker keeps whatever the operator
   * chose (still fully clickable to any option — "never locked" means the
   * suggestion never disables the control, not that it stops suggesting).
   *
   * ## Partial means per-section, not "every section required"
   *
   * `sectionDecisions` may cover a subset of `sectionKeys` — `allowPartial`
   * describes decision GRANULARITY (independent per-section verdicts), not
   * a requirement that every section be decided before submitting. Only the
   * overall decision (and feedback when rejecting/requesting changes) gate
   * the submit button.
