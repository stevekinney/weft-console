   * Capabilities panel (plan §9.6; design `Weft Console.dc.html` STORAGE
   * "stCaps"): `DescriptionList` with persistence badge + durable-recovery
   * checklist.
   *
   * **What's real vs. what's honestly unavailable.** Weft has no operation
   * exposing `Storage.capabilities()` over the wire at all (verified against
   * the full v0.11.0 operation catalog) — filed upstream:
   * https://github.com/stevekinney/weft/issues/727. Fabricating
   * persistence/consistency/durable-recovery-checklist values with no wire
   * signal would be placeholder content presented as fact, so this panel
   * shows only what a remote client can actually establish today:
   *   - **Batch operations**: always supported — `weft.storage.batch`
   *     applies its operations unconditionally, no capability gate exists
   *     on that route (`storageBatchOperation.invoke` in
   *     `src/server/operations/storage.ts`).
   *   - **Conditional batch**: from the `conditionalBatchSupported` probe
   *     result passed in by `index.svelte` (see `storage-client.ts`'s
   *     `probeConditionalBatchSupported` doc comment).
   * Persistence, read-after-write, scan consistency, atomic-batch, and the
   * durable-recovery checklist (`assertDurableStorageForRecovery`'s five
   * checks) all require that missing operation — the banner below says so
   * rather than guessing.
