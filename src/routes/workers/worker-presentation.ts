/**
 * Pure presentation-state derivation for worker/deployment rows (plan §9.9(1)
 * "runtime-state derivation pattern" — a priority-ordered pure function
 * instead of an if/else pile — adopted for the Workers track).
 *
 * ## Deliberately no "reconnecting (grace period)" state
 *
 * Plan §9.4 asks the UI to show "reconnecting (grace period)" for a worker
 * that drops and reconnects within `workerReconnectGracePeriodMs`
 * (`weft/src/server/serve-internals.ts`, clamped `[0, 5000]`, default ~2s)
 * rather than "flapping to disconnected". Traced against the wire
 * (`weft/src/server/runtime/authentication-bridge.ts`): during the grace
 * window the worker stays fully registered — same `WorkerSummary`, same
 * `health` — and `WorkerDisconnectedEvent` (`worker:disconnected`) fires
 * only AFTER the window expires and the requeue actually runs. There is no
 * wire-observable "this worker just entered its grace window" signal to
 * derive a distinct UI state from. Faking one off `heartbeatAgeMs` would be
 * wrong on its own terms (heartbeat cadence and the ~2s grace window are
 * unrelated timescales) and would misfire on real data — e.g. the design
 * mock's draining worker at a 1m12s heartbeat age, which must read
 * "Draining", never "reconnecting".
 *
 * What this module delivers instead is the requirement's actual intent:
 * never derive a client-side "disconnected" verdict for a worker present in
 * the current `weft.workers.list` snapshot — every function below only ever
 * classifies workers *that are in the list*, and callers must treat the
 * list itself (not a locally patched view) as truth. A per-worker
 * reconnecting/in-grace flag is a candidate follow-up on
 * https://github.com/stevekinney/weft/issues/729, not something to
 * approximate client-side.
