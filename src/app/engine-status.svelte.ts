/**
 * The shell's one shared `FleetEventSource` connection (plan §5's ≤3-socket
 * connection budget: "one fleet SSE … never per-row/per-surface
 * connections") plus the `/v1/health` polling fallback that backs the
 * sidebar's engine-status pill (plan §13 T1.6).
 *
 * `FleetEventSource`'s `baseUrl`/`headers` reuse the already-constructed
 * `HttpClient`'s own public `baseUrl`/`headers` fields verbatim (both
 * `readonly` on `HttpClient`, `weft/src/client/http-client.ts`) rather than
 * re-deriving them from runtime config — `HttpClient` and `FleetEventSource`
 * are proven, by `live-source-test-server.test-support.ts` (T1.4's own
 * integration-test harness), to expect the SAME unprefixed origin (no
 * `/api`; the server's HTTP front door matches `/v1/...` directly, `/api`
 * being an optional external namespace it strips before routing) — so no
 * new base-URL-resolution logic is needed here at all.
 *
 * Every notification-worthy frame is forwarded into the shell's
 * `NotificationStore` (`./notifications.svelte.ts`) — this module is the
 * ONE place a fleet frame is received and fanned out, so a future
 * dashboard/list-liveness consumer subscribing to the same shared source
 * never doubles the connection.
 *
 * Critical/warning notifications additionally spawn a real toast (design
 * `Weft New Surfaces.dc.html` §C: "critical → strip + toast, warning →
 * toast, info → bell only"), gated on `FleetEventSource.caughtUp` — a fresh
 * connection replays up to 1,000 historical fleet events before it, and
 * every one of those would otherwise toast on page load. `ingest()` still
 * runs unconditionally, so the bell dropdown/critical strip reflect the full
 * replayed backlog; only the ephemeral toast is suppressed for it.
