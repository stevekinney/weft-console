/**
 * Playwright fixtures shared by every persona-flow spec (plan §11.4).
 *
 * ## Why route interception, not the `<ApiKeyEntry>` UI
 *
 * `src/app/app.svelte` mounts `<ApiKeyEntry>` in place of the shell only
 * when boot-time principal resolution 401s with no credential
 * (`resolvePrincipal(client, { credentialed: false })` — see that module's
 * doc). Driving that form on every test would work, but the entered key
 * lives in component state only (`src/lib/client.ts`'s `setApiKey()`:
 * "never `localStorage`, never a cookie"), so it evaporates on any full
 * navigation — brittle for flows that `page.goto()` a route directly
 * (reviews inbox, schedules, workers) rather than reaching it via in-app
 * links from `/`.
 *
 * Instead, `withApiKeyInjected` rewrites the `<script type="application/json"
 * id="weft-console-config">` block on every DOCUMENT response (not
 * asset/XHR requests) to add `token`, matching the shape
 * `src/lib/config.ts`'s `readRuntimeConfig()` already validates. Every full
 * navigation — the first `page.goto()` and any later one — boots the app
 * already credentialed, so `app.svelte`'s boot probe succeeds immediately
 * and the shell mounts straight into `phase: 'ready'`. No test in this
 * suite needs to touch `<ApiKeyEntry>` itself; that surface is a Cinder
 * component-test concern (`src/app/auth/*.test.ts`), not this suite's.

/**
 * Polls every button/input's `background-color`/`color` across consecutive
 * animation frames until two consecutive samples are identical (or a bounded
 * number of frames elapses), so axe reads settled paint, not a
 * mid-transition blend.
 *
 * `foundation.css`'s reduced-motion rule (`*, ::before, ::after {
 * transition-duration: 0.01ms !important; }`, confirmed live against the
 * built CSS) collapses every Cinder transition to sub-frame length under
 * `use.reducedMotion: 'reduce'` (`playwright.config.ts`) — but "sub-frame"
 * still means the browser can paint an intermediate frame of an
 * interpolating `background-color`/`color` transition (e.g. a button's
 * disabled→enabled color swap, which every "fill the form, then check the
 * now-enabled submit button" step in this suite triggers) before settling.
 * Confirmed empirically, twice, with a fixed two-`requestAnimationFrame`
 * wait still in place: axe's own `color-contrast` check sampled a
 * DIFFERENT transitional blend on each run (`bgColor: '#adc1f3'` then
 * `'#5c79e7'`) on the identical "Submit decision" button, while a
 * `getComputedStyle` read moments later on the same element consistently
 * showed the correct settled `oklch(0.5 0.22 270)` background / `oklch(1 0
 * 0)` text (21:1) — so a FIXED frame count isn't a reliable bound here;
 * polling until the sample stops changing is.
 *
 * Cinder 0.21 added real `@starting-style` entry transitions to Modal and
 * Drawer, which exposed a second sampling hazard this poll alone cannot
 * see: the overlay PANEL fades in via `opacity`, and axe composites each
 * control's colors through that translucent ancestor — so a button whose
 * own `background-color`/`color` are already settled (signature stable)
 * still measures as a washed-out blend (observed: the drain dialog's
 * primary button flagged at 2.88:1 with bg `#8390ea` while its computed
 * resting style was the correct `oklch(0.5 0.22 270)` / 21:1). Two
 * additions close it: `waitForAnimationsToFinish` first awaits every
 * finite animation/transition on the page (near-instant under this
 * suite's `reducedMotion: 'reduce'`), and the signature below includes
 * `opacity` so an ancestor fade is itself detected as unsettled paint.
