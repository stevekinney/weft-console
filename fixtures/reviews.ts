/**
 * Human-review demo fixtures (plan §11, Appendix B "Review inbox + decision
 * (partial sections) / completed / timeout-expired / archive"). Adds a
 * pending sectioned/partial review, a completed review decided with a
 * partial (mixed) section outcome, and a pending review with a
 * short-relative-to-normal timeout. `fixtures/workflows.ts`'s existing
 * `review-gate` already covers the plain (non-partial, effectively
 * unbounded) pending case; this file rounds out the set. See
 * `fixtures/workflows.ts` for the append-only contract this file
